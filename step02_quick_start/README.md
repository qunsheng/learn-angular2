# Angular QuickStart Source


## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

just download files from  https://github.com/angular/quickstart and copy to workspace


## Install npm packages


Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then you will see "Hollo Angular" show up in browser.

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
